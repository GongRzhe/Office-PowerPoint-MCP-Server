- **Critical:** 1 (Path Traversal)
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 0
- **Low:** 0

### Status
✅ **All vulnerabilities have been patched and verified**

---

## Audit Methodology

The security audit followed these steps:

1. **Dependency Analysis:** Scanned all Python dependencies using `pip-audit` for known CVEs
2. **Code Review:** Manual review of server logic and tool implementations
3. **Path Analysis:** Examined all file I/O operations for security vulnerabilities
4. **Verification Testing:** Created and executed security tests to verify the fix

---

## Findings

### 1. Path Traversal Vulnerability (CRITICAL) ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** Fixed  
**CVE:** N/A (Custom vulnerability)

#### Description
The MCP server was vulnerable to path traversal attacks in file operations. The following functions accepted user-supplied file paths without proper sanitization:

- `open_presentation(file_path)` - Opens PowerPoint files
- `create_presentation_from_template(template_path)` - Creates presentations from templates
- `save_presentation(presentation, file_path)` - Saves presentations to disk
- `get_template_info(template_path)` - Reads template information

#### Attack Vector
An attacker could provide malicious paths such as:
- `../../../../etc/passwd` - Read sensitive system files
- `../../../.ssh/id_rsa` - Access SSH keys
- `../../config/secrets.json` - Access configuration files

#### Impact
- **Confidentiality:** HIGH - Unauthorized file read access
- **Integrity:** HIGH - Unauthorized file write access
- **Availability:** MEDIUM - Potential for denial of service

#### Affected Files
- `tools/presentation_tools.py` - Tool implementations
- `utils/presentation_utils.py` - Utility functions for file operations

#### Solution Implemented

**1. Created Path Sanitization Function** (`utils/core_utils.py`)
```python
def sanitize_path(file_path: str, base_dir: Optional[str] = None, 
                  allow_absolute: bool = False) -> str:
    """
    Sanitize a file path to prevent path traversal attacks.
    
    - Resolves absolute paths
    - Validates paths are within allowed directory
    - Prevents directory traversal with ../
    - Optionally allows absolute paths for legitimate use cases
    """
```

**2. Updated File Operations** (`utils/presentation_utils.py`)
- Modified `open_presentation()` to use `sanitize_path()`
- Modified `create_presentation_from_template()` to use `sanitize_path()`
- Modified `save_presentation()` to use `sanitize_path()`
- Modified `get_template_info()` to use `sanitize_path()`

#### Verification
Created comprehensive security tests (`test_security.py`) that verify:
- ✅ Normal relative paths work correctly
- ✅ Path traversal attempts are blocked (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`)
- ✅ Subdirectory paths work correctly
- ✅ Absolute paths work when explicitly allowed
- ✅ Complex traversal attempts are blocked (e.g., `templates/../../../etc/passwd`)

All tests passed successfully.

## Dependency Analysis

### Tool Used
`pip-audit` version 2.9.0

### Results
```
No known vulnerabilities found
```

### Dependencies Scanned
- `mcp[cli]` (1.18.0)
- `python-pptx` (1.0.2)
- `Pillow` (12.0.0)
- `fonttools` (4.60.1)
- All transitive dependencies

**Status:** ✅ All dependencies are secure with no known CVEs

---

## Additional Security Observations

### Positive Security Practices Found

1. **Input Validation:** The server includes parameter validation functions:
   - `validate_parameters()` - General parameter validation
   - `is_positive()`, `is_non_negative()` - Numeric validation
   - `is_valid_rgb()` - Color validation
   - `is_in_range()`, `is_in_list()` - Range and list validation

2. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks

3. **Modular Architecture:** Well-organized code structure with separation of concerns

4. **Type Hints:** Extensive use of Python type hints for better code safety

### Recommendations for Future Security

1. **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate limiting for MCP tool calls to prevent abuse

2. **Logging:** Add security event logging for:
   - Failed path traversal attempts
   - Unusual file access patterns
   - Authentication failures (if authentication is added)

3. **File Size Limits:** Implement maximum file size limits for uploads/saves to prevent DoS

4. **Sandboxing:** Consider running the server in a containerized environment with limited file system access

5. **Authentication:** If exposing via HTTP/SSE, implement proper authentication and authorization

6. **Input Sanitization:** Continue to validate and sanitize all user inputs, especially:
   - Text content (check for injection attacks)
   - Color values
   - Numeric parameters

## Testing Evidence

### Security Test Results
```
Testing path sanitization...
------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Test 1 PASSED: Normal relative path
✓ Test 2 PASSED: Path traversal blocked
✓ Test 3 PASSED: Subdirectory path
